# test-task-ruby-internship
My test task for Ruby internship

This is my first task using Ruby program language.
Decided to do a task in Ruby to understand the syntax of the language.

For the first and second tasks did not create classes as decided that they would be redundant.

For the third task created a Town class. 
Also for this task I used the permutation method instead of writing it myself
